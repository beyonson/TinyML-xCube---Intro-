# TinyML-xCube---Intro-
Hello world activity for STM32CubeIDE 

This project includes information for training a model in tensorflow, converting it to TF Lite, and running inference on an STM32L476RGx board.

Takeaways:

Pros
- Compared to TF Lite for Microcontrollers, xCube AI uses about 40% less flash space, and is about 25% faster (for this project)
- Out of the different libraries explored, cubeIDE has been the easiest to work with
- Can easily accept pre-trained models from keras and tflite

Cons
- xCube AI is closed source
- xCube used about 4% more RAM than TF Lite for microcontrollers (for this project)


NOTICE:

I did not design or create this exercise, most of this project was learned from various tutorials created by Digi-Key and Tensorflow.
